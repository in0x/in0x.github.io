        <h1> Helmet Squishers </h1>
        <p> Helmet Squisher is a 2D platform fighter for 2 players developed in 2 days for a Game Jam at the UAS Salzburg under the motto
        'It's not a bug, it's a feature'. The goal of the game is to squish your enemy three times by jumping on their head. </p>

        <p> However, you can make your life easier or harder through activating one of the games modifiers:<p>

        <ul>
            <li> Flip the games gravity by jumping on an activator pad.</li>
            <li> Kick the enemy into a random direction, also via one of the activator pads.</li>
            <li> Turn of your character light to sneak up to the enemy.</li>
        </ul>

        <p> Everytime you jump there is also a chance of teleporting to a random position, which could work for (porting you away just before getting hit)
            or against (ruining your perfectly set up squish) you.</p>

        <h1> Reality Ruckus </h1>
        <p> My current project is a 2D semi turn-based Roguelike called Realtity Ruckus.
          It is being developed in cooperation with 2 of my fellow students as part of our MMP2a (MultiMediaProject).</p>
        <p> In Reality Ruckus, you are a hero who has been chosen to restore order to time and space following a catastrophic event which collapsed multiple
            realites into each other. Along the way you will meet fellow heroes who have been forced to leave their dimension. </p>
        <p> You will have to explore randomly generated areas and face a multitude of foes in order to collect fragments of an artifact, which is the only hope
             to restore order back to space and time.</p>
        <p>Upon finding all artifact fragments in an area, your hero will have to travel to the next dimension, where he will have to face new challenges.<p>

        <h1> Flight </h1>
        <p> Flight was the first full game I made I felt was worthy of putting it out. It was created for my second semester MMP. You race through a foggy forest, continously getting faster
          while dodging trees in your path and collecting pick-ups that double your score multiplier and slow or speed you up.</p>
        <p>Play it <a href="flight/index.html">here (Note: this build might have been messed up by server migration over the summer)</a></p>
        <p><a href="http://slides.com/philippwelsch/deck-2#/">This slideshow (german)</a> provides a more in-depth explanation of the game.</p>
