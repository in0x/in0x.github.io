		  <p>Major League Gladiators is a 2-player co-op shooter in VR. Two players have to cooperate, using their unique weapons and abilities, 
		  to survive as long as possible against waves of enemies in an arena.</p>
		  
		  <p> This is the final project of my team of five bachelor degree students of MultiMediaTechnology (MMT) 
		  at University of Applied Sciences Salzburg (FHS). We also cooperated with students from MultiMediaArt (MMA) for our asset creation.
		  The project started in January 2017 and was completed in June 2017.</p>
		  
		  <p> I took the role of lead developer on the project. My responsiblities include:
			<ul>
				<li><p>Designing and implementing systems for other programmers to build upon</p></li>
				<li><p>Consulting other developers on their designs</p></li>
				<li><p>Extending and maintining our custom build of Unreal Engine 4</p></li>
				<li><p>Creating and evolving the game design</p></li>
				<li><p>Regularly presenting our progress to stakeholders</p></li>
			</ul>
		  </p>
		  
      <p> Major League Gladiators was built using Unreal Engine 4 (UE4) and supports the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift.</p>
      <p> The game is available on Steam for free! 
        Check out <a href="http://majorleaguegladiators.presskithero.com/">the presskit</a> and the <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/727310/Major_League_Gladiators/">Steam page</a> for more info.</p>

      <h1> Reality Ruckus </h1>
      <p> A 2D semi turn-based Roguelike developed in cooperation with 2 of my fellow students as part of our MMP2a (MultiMediaProject).</p>
      <p> In Reality Ruckus, you are a hero who has been chosen to restore order to time and space following a catastrophic event which collapsed multiple
          realites into each other. Along the way you will meet fellow heroes who have been forced to leave their dimension. </p>
      <p> You will have to explore randomly generated areas and face a multitude of foes in order to collect fragments of an artifact, which is the only hope
            to restore order back to space and time.</p>
      <p>Upon finding all artifact fragments in an area, your hero will have to travel to the next dimension, where he will have to face new challenges.<p>

        <h1> Flight </h1>
        <p> Flight was the first full game I made I felt was worthy of putting it out. It was created for my second semester project. You race through a foggy forest, continously getting faster
          while dodging trees in your path and collecting pick-ups that double your score multiplier and slow or speed you up.</p>

          <h1> Gravity Ruckus </h1>
          <p> A four player, local multiplayer FPS where players can flip their gravity by 90Â° in any direction at any time. The game was built
          by two of my colleagues and me during our 4. bachelor semester using Unity. Sadly due to time constraints and the difficulties that the gravity system
          added to the game design, it wasn't fully realized. The full source can be found <a href="https://github.com/in0x/Gravity_Ruckus">here</a>. </p>
